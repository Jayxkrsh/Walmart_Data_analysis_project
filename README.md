# Walmart Data Analysis: End-to-End SQL + Python Project 
## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.

## Tools and Technologies Used

### Python:
* Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and cleaning.
* Libraries used:
pandas for data manipulation.
numpy for numerical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.

### MySQL:
* Used to store the cleaned data.
*Structured Query Language (SQL) for EDA and answering business questions.

## Workflow

### Data Exploration and Cleaning:

* Imported the Walmart dataset into Jupyter Notebook.
* Performed data exploration:
Identified missing values.
Checked for duplicate records.
Analyzed data distributions.

* Cleaned the data by:
Filling or removing missing values.
Standardizing column names.
Removing duplicates.

### Data Loading to MySQL:
* Created a MySQL database and table schema to store the cleaned data.
* Loaded the cleaned data into the MySQL database.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in MySQL:
* Used SQL queries to:
Analyze sales trends by branch, category, and time.
Identify the highest-performing product categories.
Determine peak transaction times.
Analyze customer purchasing patterns.

### Business Questions Answered:

* Identified the most popular product categories based on sales volume.
* Analyzed transaction patterns across different times of the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).
* Determined the highest sales-generating branches.
* Explored the relationship between customer traffic and specific time periods.

## Insights and Findings
* Top Performing Branches
* Peak Transaction Times
* Popular Categories
* Customer Patterns

## Future Scope
* Automate the entire data pipeline using Python scripts.
* Implement visualization dashboards using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
* Expand analysis to include customer segmentation and predictive analytics.
